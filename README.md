# FTIR
Programm taking a spectrum using Michelson Interferometer. This setup is designed to work with a PI stage and as a detector we use a pyrodetector which is connected to a scope from TiePie
The program is so far is only tested on windows, but should in principal also work on linux

Requirements:
- PiPython: library which is a up now unofficial python wrapper from PI for their own GCS library available upon request
- LibTiePie: library from TiePie for accessing the scope, just install it as described on the website
